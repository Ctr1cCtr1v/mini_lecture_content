# Obfuscation Decoding Challenge
## Scenario:
You are a security analyst tasked with reviewing suspicious network traffic as part of an ongoing investigation into a potential breach at your organization. During the investigation, you come across a strange string of hexadecimal values in a network log file. The string appears to be obfuscated but could hold important information about the source of an attack.

**Hereâ€™s the string you find in the log file**: 

`4d 44 67 77 4f 44 6f 31 4d 69 34 78 4c 6a 67 32 4d 53 34 79 4f 54 45 76 4c 7a 70 77 64 48 52 6f`

Your task is to decode this obfuscated string and determine its true content. The output of this obfuscated string will help you track down the source of suspicious network activity.
